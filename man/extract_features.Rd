extract_features(
  neurons_list,
  features_list = NULL,
  y = NULL,
  to_numeric = FALSE,
  normalise = c("none", "zscore", "scale"),

\method{extract_features}{neuronlist}(
  neurons_list,
  features_list = NULL,
  y = NULL,
  to_numeric = FALSE,
  normalise = c("none", "zscore", "scale"),
  split_proportion = NULL,
  remove_nas = TRUE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{neurons_list}{neuronlist of neurons (nat)}

\item{features_list}{list with feature names of functions that
generate them}

\item{y}{target class (can be character of function), will be added as column
"Y" if name is NULL.}

\item{to_numeric}{flag that says whether all factor/ character features are
meant to be transformed to numeric (default: F)}

\item{normalise}{what normalization to use}

\item{split_proportion}{if numeric then it splits dataset into train test.
The number should be a target proportion of test cases (although not
guaranteed as it makes sure that there's at least one element per class).}

\item{remove_nas}{flags whether to remove NAs or not}

\item{n_jobs}{number of cores used to call a function feature extraction}

\item{...}{extra arguments}
}
\value{
data frame with features
}
